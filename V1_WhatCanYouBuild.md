## What can you build?

The Watson Work Services platform can support apps in Watson Workspace, or you can make them available on their own. That's great, but what's that mean? You can build apps that can:

- Send interactive [messages into a space](guides/V1_wwsg_Spaces.md)

- Listen & respond to events automatically via [outbound webhooks](guides/V1_wwsg_Webhooks.md)

- Allow users to initiate actions using [conversational text](guides/V1_Action_Fulfillment.md)

You can also make apps that use cognitive capabilities to understand users' conversations and interactions. Your app can suggest actions, recognize sentiment, or provide expertise. And, they can be trained to understand business dialect associated with specific domains or industries. For example, a sales team has different terminology than a medical team. Here are a few we've come up with, we can't wait to see what you do!

- Make it easy for users to catch up by summarizing the conversation with [Moments](guides/V1_wwsg_MomentIdentification.md)

- Analyze and extract key information such as keywords, sentiment, dates, and more with [Information Extraction annotations](guides/V1_Annotation_Message_Information_Extraction.md)

- Identify [focuses](guides/V1_wwsg_ActionIdentification.md) (key phrases) within the conversation and suggest actions users can take inline with [Action Fulfillment](guides/V1_Action_Fulfillment.md).
