# Administering a space

Watson Work Services offers APIs for managing spaces. This includes adding owners and transferring owners allowing different levels of access within the context of a space. This happens though SpaceRoles. A SpaceRole defines the control a user has in that space.. For example, a user with the SpaceRole SPACE_OWNER can delete the space.
