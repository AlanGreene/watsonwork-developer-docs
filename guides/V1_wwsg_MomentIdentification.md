## Moments

Moments is a smart tool using the power of Watson to help you determine when to jump into fast moving conversations. Moments also help you understand the significance of activity that has transpired since your last time in the space. Moments are visualized as summaries of the conversation broken down by moments in time.  

A moment typically includes:
- The **people** that were participating in the conversation during a particular time window
- The topics or **key phrases** that were extracted from the conversation
- A **most relevant message** that best represents the conversation at the time (and generally includes the key phrases)
