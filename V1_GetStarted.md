### Welcome to Watson Work Services

Hi!  Thanks for checking out Watson Work Services.  You've come to the right place if you want to build apps that take advantage of conversational + cognitive services, powered by Watson.   With Watson Work Services, you can build capabilities to customize your team's use of Watson Workspace, and create apps that will integrate with Watson Workspace for anyone to add to their spaces, and you can also develop apps for other business tools.  

These services are built for extensibility.  They are meant to extend your experience with Watson Workspace and your everyday tools - making it easier for you and others to get work done.

In Watson Workspace, users get work done in a space, a virtual workspace.  They can converse, share files, work with other tools and more.  There are cognitive capabilities such as moments and action fulfillment built in.   As an app developer, there is a lot you can do to enhance that experience and other similar conversational experiences.  

So let's get started building an app with Watson Work Services.
