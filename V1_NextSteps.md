## Next steps

Great!  You're off and running!  

First, check out the rest of the developer documentation to learn how to make your app sing. Since you'll be using GraphQL we've prepared a [quick intro](guides/V1_wwsg_DevelopersGuide.md) so you can learn how to make the magic happen. If you still need a kickstart with building your first app check out this [tutorial](guides/V1_Action_Fulfillment.md). We also have [sample apps on Github](https://github.com/watsonwork) that can help you understand what you can do with Watson Work Services. If you need more help, let us know and talk to other developers in our [forums](https://help.workspace.ibm.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/201192468-Developers).

You can start building your app on [IBM Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/), which is a platform and other services that can host your app. Create a free account and get started!

You can make basic changes to your app, like changing the name, description, or deleting it in your app's dashboard. Click **Apps** in the main navigation at the top of this page, or click this link to the your [Apps page](https://developer.watsonwork.ibm.com/apps) to find your app and modify it. You can also supercharge it with these fantastic features.

- [Make your app cognitive](guides/V1_cognitive_app.md) to associate an instance of Watson Conversation.
- [Make your app configurable](guides/V1_MakeAppsConfigurable.md) to allow users to customize or configure preferences for your app.
- [Listen to events](guides/V1_wwsg_Webhooks.md) in a space by adding a Webhook to your app.
- [Share your app](guides/V1_ShareAnApp.md) with friends and colleagues by generating the HTML for a share button.
