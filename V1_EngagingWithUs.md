## Engaging with us

We are continually adding value and want to include you as early as possible in our development process so we can include 
your input and feedback. Some features are stable (in that they will not change), others are in progress of being built which we call **beta** 
and others are things we want to try and discover what would work best, we call **experimental**. Additionally, when we are about to 
introduce something new and want to get feedback on the concepts and understanding before we expose API’s, so that your 
feedback can inform and guide the future API, we will call these **future**. Also, **future** may, (but not always), include the ability for you to 
play with an API, through one of our tools (like the GraphQL Explorer), so you can have some experience with it and give us 
feedback to help inform and improve things.

API’s that are going to be going out of service will be called **deprecated**, which means that while this is still available 
for developers to use, it will be removed and calls to this API will no longer work. They will be kept on to provide backward 
compatibility, and to provide time for developers to update affected code.

You will see these various categories called out on those specific APIs. All other, undecorated API references are 
considered published and are fully supported. 

To provide more transparency in how we’re working and what we’re building, we will surface our content in markdown files in 
the github repo - [github.com/watsonwork/watsonwork-developer-docs](httpa://github.com/watsonwork/watsonwork-developer-docs) so that you can engage with us through github to inform 
and provide feedback to help make and design great APIs.

### How we make our developer experience

We build our developer experience [developer.watsonwork.ibm.com](https://developer.watsonwork.ibm.com) through the use of the files we 
keep in the github repository mentioned above. When we build, we only bring in those files that are marked as **published**, **beta** 
or **deprecated**, and do not add those marked as **future** or **experimental**.
