# Focus


<a name="overview"></a>
## Overview
The Focus API provides a mechanism for our Cognitive service to analyze your text to see if there are any potential areas of focus.

You can send the Focus API a text string that contains one or more sentences, and the service will analyze each sentence.  It will view the text through several different lenses.  A lens is a particular way of looking at the text.  A focus is a result of that lens applied to the given text where the lens has found something interesting. If the lens is "action" or "question", then a particular action or question identified by the lens is a "focus".  The API returns a list of focuses found during the analysis.  That list can be empty (no focuses found), or it might contain one or more focuses.  A confidence level for each focus prediction is included in the response.
